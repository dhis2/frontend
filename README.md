# Discussion Board

**NOTE: Way of Work information (`wow-frontend`) is being migrated to the [Developer Portal](dhis2.github.io)**

Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2.github.io/issues) there if something is missing

This repository has been renamed to `notes` to serve the purpose of recording decisions and discussions over time.

## Proposals / Discussion

Create an issue in GitHub, it can be discussed in the issue, and then a
decision taken in a meeting if necessary.

## Meeting minutes / Decisions

Create a markdown file with the date `DD.md` as the name, under the
correct directory `YYYY/MM`.

Raise a PR to get it approved and/or discussed, and finally merged from
some of the meeting participants.

See [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md).
