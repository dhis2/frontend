# Notes

> These notes are written after the meeting took place.

## UI docs renovation

Thanks for the demo, Kai.

General consensus was that it looks good and we should move forward with
the proposal and outline the next steps.

## Developer outreach

There are new webinars and workshops coming up, if you want to get
involved you are very welcome. Contact Debora and/or Austin to get it
rolling.

## PR Preview

Thanks for the proposal, Christos.

Outcome: we settled on Netlify.
Next steps: we need to have` *.netlify.app` in the CORS whitelist of the DHIS2 instances that will be used.
It was suggested that @paschalidi would create a proof of concept which will build the `standalone` frontend app on `gh-actions` and then push on Netlify the results of the build. This way we will be saving build minutes time on Netlify.

## How is the JIRA consolidation going?

After moving all the issues from GitHub Issues to JIRA there are still
from rough edges, but overall it is working nicely.

We need to figure out how the workflows and statuses should be to make
it work consistently without introducing unnecessary cruft that doesn't
add value.

## Dynamic runtime modules

We ran out of time so this is due for the next meeting.

## Other

Nothing came up due to lack of time remaining.
