## Working groups

### GQL => App Runtime Queries

https://jira.dhis2.org/browse/LIBS-158

Opt-in variant to use GraphQL queries instead of our own Query object
notation.

Some benefits include, better syntax highlighting and static query
analysis for validation etc.

### UI#463 / DataTable

There is a clear way forward, so should be able to be merged soon. Maybe
even as soon as next week.

### Cypress / Network Shim

It's been a roller coaster, but the network shim is working !

### PWA

Work is progressing nicely.

ServiceWorker can be configured and opted in through d2.config.js and
then picked up by the build scripts.

Initial integration into an app this week or the next.

New UI features are going to be requested, will be added as Jira tickets
and to the Q&A section.

### Redesign for the App Hub
