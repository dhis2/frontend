# Test automation strategy

Date: 2020-10-21 @ 14:15

Attending: Jan-Gerke, Phil, Gintare, Viktor, Jennifer, Ismay, Austin

## Agenda

1.  Re-using Feature files across Dev/QA/Externals?
2.  Zephyr and its use
3.  Code quality reports (coverage, etc.)

## Notes

-   QA Team needs a Test Report.

-   Test Report is currently generated/pulled out from Zephyr.

-   Posting test results to Zephyr from E2E tests in Apps.

-   Libraries are not considered by the QA team, do not need E2E
    coverage.

-   Let's use SonarCloud across our code repos for code quality gates.

-   Iteratively figure out a way to integrate the development process
    and QA process.

-   We are not going to get feature files for each bug report, it is not
    a realistic goal.

-   Re-use the QA Zephyr/WebDriver integration? Follow-up.

-   Frontend team can proceed and develop a strategy going forward.
