When running `yarn install` in projects which depend on very large packages Yarn hits the timeout limit and eventually throws the error `ESOCKETTIMEDOUT`.

```sh
yarn install

yarn install v1.13.0

## Troubleshooting

It is helpful to run the `yarn install` command with the `--verbose` switch to get additional information as well.

```sh
yarn install --verbose

yarn install v1.13.0
verbose 0.568 Found configuration file "/home/varl/.yarnrc".

## Solution

Increasing the `network-timeout` for Yarn is one way to fix it. You can choose to increase the limit globally or per-project. I did it globally in the example below. The configuration option accepts milliseconds. Here I set it to 10 minutes for _**OVERKILL**_ ðŸ˜Ž.

```sh
yarn config set network-timeout 600000 -g

yarn config v1.13.0
success Set "network-timeout" to "600000".
Done in 0.04s.
```

## Bonus solution

The only package I've seen this problem on is the [`material-design-icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-design-icons) package which has a ridiculous amount of files in a large package format. If you only need the iconfont, the [`material-design-icons-iconfont`](https://github.com/Jossef/material-design-icons-iconfont) works as a drop-in replacement and is a lot smaller (package-wise).
