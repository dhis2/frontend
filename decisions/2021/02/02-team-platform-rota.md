# Notes

Team Platform are currently the primary contact points for questions
about the common frontend libraries: app platform, runtime, cli, and
perhaps most of all UI.

At the moment, Slack is used to ask questions and get answers, and this
is becoming a problem:

-   If the answer needs follow-up later, then the question becomes lost
    in Slack.

-   Once a question is answered, the question _and_ answer becomes lost
    in Slack.

-   We have a desire to be responsive to questions in Slack, but we also
    have a desire to do focused work without interuptions.

-   We reiterate that we need to document recipes as an answer to
    questions we receive, but we don't have time to do so.

-   It often ends up being that the same people answer questions that
    relate to what they know best, which arbitrarily limits knowledge
    spreading.

There are two changes suggested:

1.  Questions need to be asked in the Q&A category of the dhis2/notes
    discussion forum: https://github.com/dhis2/notes/discussions/categories/q-a

2.  Team Platform are introducing a daily rotation of who answers
    questions that day.

Using the discussion board for questions allows us a light-weight way to
respond to questions on how to do things, if something doesn't work as
intended, or other questions; basically whatever is asked on Slack we'd
like to see asked here.

We can mark questions as answered, track bugs that spawn from the issue,
link to recipes, etc. using a light-weight process.

Starting today we will start our rotation of who is answering questions
that day.
