# Notes

Team Platform are currently the primary contact points for questions
about the common frontend libraries: app platform, runtime, cli, and
perhaps most of all UI.

At the moment, Slack is used to ask questions and get answers, and this
is becoming a problem:

-   If the answer needs follow-up later, then the question becomes lost
    in Slack.

-   Once a question is answered, the question _and_ answer becomes lost
    in Slack.

-   We have a desire to be responsive to questions in Slack, but we also
    have a desire to do focused work without interuptions.

-   We reiterate that we need to document recipes as an answer to
    questions we receive, but we don't have time to do so.

-   It often ends up being that the same people answer questions that
    relate to what they know best, which arbitrarily limits knowledge
    spreading.

There are two changes suggested:

1.  Questions need to be asked in the Q&A category of the dhis2/notes
    discussion forum: https://github.com/dhis2/notes/discussions/categories/q-a

2.  Team Platform are introducing a daily rotation of who answers
    questions that day.

Using the discussion board for questions allows us a light-weight way to
respond to questions on how to do things, if something doesn't work as
intended, or other questions; basically whatever is asked on Slack we'd
like to see asked here.

We can mark questions as answered, track bugs that spawn from the issue,
link to recipes, etc. using a light-weight process.

Starting today we will start our rotation of who is answering questions
that day.

# Guidance on what to do when on-duty

The "on-duty" day is a day that can basically optimized for shallow
work that is easy to jump in and out of when needed, as opposed to
the other days that should be easier to optimize for deep work.

## Chores

A non-exhaustive list of suggestions that are suitable for on-duty days:

-   respond to support requests,
-   funnel questions to the right forum (usually notes/discussions),
-   find answers for questions,
-   provide guidance on what to report and where,
-   work on bug fixes that are reasonable in scope,
-   add answers to questions to the appropriate docs,
-   update dependencies,
-   other small chores that we never get time for otherwise,
-   ...
