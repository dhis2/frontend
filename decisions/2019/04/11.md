## #31 Validation of config objects

**Conclusion**: This is inherently a problem that depends on the
context.

The general rule for parameters is the relative standard:

- Less than 3 params can be positional
- 3 and above warrants a configuation object.

Validation should be considered compile-time and runtime for the
required properties. Should be flexible and accept parameters which are
unknown to the function.

Mixing configuration objects and parameters? Ultimately a judgement
call. Sometimes it makes sense to have e.g. `fetchUrl('google.com',
{})`. Be mindful during code reviews.

## #23 Which future syntax do we want to use in our js?

**Conclusion**: Stage-4, with few exceptions (based on the
react-scripts), for example class-based-props.

New exceptions should be handled with care through discussion with the
frontend group.

Be aware of logical ordering of class properties, until we are able to
delint this.

Avoid decorators where possible.

## #15 One file for one function

**Conclusion**: "It depends". Ultimately it is a judgement call for the
developers and reviewers. It can have a big impact on understanding a
code base, so do keep it in mind to err on the side of readability.
Files are cheap as Git only tracks content.

Generally smaller files are better. Use common sense as to what makes
the code easier to read and understand.

Utility files is one example where if every util function is kept in the
same file it becomes a mess and hard to read and keep track of.
Divide and conquer.
