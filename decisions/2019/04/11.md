## #31 Validation of config objects

**Conclusion**: This is inherently a problem that depends on the
context.

The general rule for parameters is the relative standard:

- Maximum **3** function parameters may be positional.

_Strict validation_: Validation should be considered compile-time and runtime for the required properties.

_Loose validation_: Should be flexible and accept parameters which are unknown to the function.

Mixing configuration objects and parameters? Ultimately a judgement
call. Sometimes it makes sense to have e.g. `fetchUrl('google.com',
{})`. Be mindful during code reviews.

## #23 Which future syntax do we want to use in our js?

**Conclusion**: We write JavaScript code according to the
[current spec](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/).

Note that not all Babel plugins have anything to do with standardized
ECMAScript, and this is not about banning the use of Babel plugins. Babel
is a very useful tool to do compile time operations and should be considered
a tool to solve problems in that space.

New exceptions (using stage-3 proposals) should be handled with care through discussion with the
frontend group.

Currently we accept:

- [tc39/proposal-class-fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) :: [@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties)

Currently we tolerate the [proposals](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/babel-preset-react-app/create.js) used by Create React App as well.

Avoid decorators where possible.

## #15 One file for one function

**Conclusion**: "It depends". Ultimately it is a judgement call for the
developers and reviewers. It can have a big impact on understanding a
code base, so do keep it in mind to err on the side of readability.
Files are cheap as Git only tracks content.

Generally smaller files are better. Use common sense as to what makes
the code easier to read and understand.

Utility files is one example where if every util function is kept in the
same file it becomes a mess and hard to read and keep track of.
Divide and conquer.
