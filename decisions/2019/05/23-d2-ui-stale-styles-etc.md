#28 How do we add cli-style to repos

- think about app the app is suitable for feature toggling

- getting some experience using feature toggling and it's working nicely

- moving to a situation where we don't backport and we move forward

- be clear about pushing back on "backport everything, all the time"

**Conclusion**: We accept the proposal outlined.

#23 Use github's stale bot / autoresponder / etc.

**Conclusion**: Ok to have these types of automations. Would be nice to
have issue templates to remind reporters about JIRA.

#20 Move to a single d2-ui package

**Conclusion**: 

ui-widgets candidates: rich-text

move to @dhis2/d2-ui, move to semantic-release, move to single
entry-point (named imports/exports)
