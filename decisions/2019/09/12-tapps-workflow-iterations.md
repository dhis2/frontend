# 2019-09-12 @dhis2/team-apps Workflow Iteration

## Attending

Viktor, Hendrik, Erik, Ismay, Jan-Gerke, Birk

## Automated functional tests

- Cypress
- Specifications (feature files)
- Regression test specs for bugs
- Does not replace unit tests, etc.
- Does replace Zephyr test cases (need to figure out how to integrate
  this with QA)
- Jan-Gerke to organise a session to demonstrate how it fits together

## Better communication across the entire frontend team regarding
libraries and shared components

## Lower barrier to voice chat

## Focus on e.g. a few large refactors at a time, opting to have more
devs working on the same thing
