## re-export files

- webpack 4 implements strict es modules for mjs files
- unclear if that's an actual specification (viktor will investigate)

## fonts

- use MDIDX for icons for the time being, look into switching to svgs
- ok for host to pull in application level fonts, but would be nice to
throw some sort of error

## down-side of isolated styles

- difficult to re-use primitives of styles

## down-side of locked down apis

- no paddings/margins atm, so everything has been wrapped in another
  components

- - document grid system for padding margin

## test ids

- data-test-id on component, pass through a property to component

## standard api

- we want a standard set of properties for all components
- not duplicate all the props on each component
- use a composable structure

- locked down to start, open up when there's a real need

## experience with implementing headerbar

- the UI component broke stuff, then it broke again when it was removed.

- translations not included with the headerbar

- - they should be!

## future

- ui components could delegate the processing the requests to the
  application

  - simple: pass in pre-configured callbacks to the components for the
    data

  - sophisticated: design a system which would allow the components to
    define what data they need (ref. apollo client, graphql, etc.):

    ```
    <Query query="{ user { name } }"> ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) return error; if (loading) return '...'; return <span>{data}</span> } </Query>
    ..
    <Query resource="analytics/event" filter="xxx">
    ```

- ui components could be configured to know where they get external data
  from

- complex components could provide reducers/actions for the apps to hook
  into the state of the component

- ui: not coupled to dhis2

- d2-ui: coupled with dhis2

## next steps

- upgrade to npm beta from github is preferable

- migrate the header-bar to d2-ui-header-bar

- make sure the headerbar is tree-shakeable, currently it does named
  imports from core which doesn't work

- start to investigate if dashboards can use some components

## accessibility

- (MAKE KB WORK FOR SEARCHING FOR APPS)
- make sure tabs works
- aria labels
- etc.

## (translations)

- how would a user contribute with translations for his language?
